This repository [1] contains all sorts of Igor [2] tests for oVirt Node.

Look into docs/ to learn how to write testsuites, testsets and testcases.
Run make pdfs to create pdfs from the .rst files.

Run 'make check' in this directory to do some basic validation of the test related files.

The remaining folders are organized as follows:
suites/		Contains testsuites (and testsuites reference testsets)
sets/		Contains testsets (and testsets reference testcases and libraries)
tcs/		Contains testcases (which are scripts)


Feel free to suggest more cases and join us at
